# Workspace

Every action you perform in Chatworth takes place within a workspace - think of it as your command center. A workspace can have members, which could be just you, your team, or your entire organization.

Your subscription plan is associated with your workspace. This means if you have a Personal Pro workspace and you decide to create a new workspace, the new workspace will default to the Free plan.

Feel free to create as many workspaces as you need.

## Members

A member of a workspace is someone who has access to that entire workspace. Once someone becomes a member of a workspace, they will be able to see this workspace in their workspace dropdown:

## Admins

Administrators are the individuals who manage the workspace. They have the ability to invite new members, check workspace settings, handle billing, and more.

## Delete a workspace

You can delete a workspace by navigating to the workspace settings:
